# Filter-design
This is a detailed report discussing the complete procedure used for designing FIR (Bandpass) and IIR(Bandpass) digital filters for prescribed specifications and its implementation on MatLAB R2021a.  This digital filter is designed for the prescribed specifications using the windowing method. The 
truncation of the impulse response is achieved using the Kaiser Window function. Here, first design an appropriate analog filter, and the required digital filter obtained by applying the bilinear transform to the transfer function of the analog filter. The report analyzes the magnitude and impulse responses  of the filter to confirm its characteristics with initial parameter.
